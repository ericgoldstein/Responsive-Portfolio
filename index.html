			<p>Eric was born in Poughkeepsie New York in 1973 to a IBM'er so he moved around the first 13 years of his life till he landed in Boulder Colorado. After heading off to the University of Arizona for school he found the game of golf. This caused a 4 year break from school as he went off to become a Golf Professional. Eventually he went back to school and graduated from Metro State College of Denver in 2010.</p>
			<p>After school he left the Golf busniess to open his own resturante and then on to running multipule stores for Qdoba Mexican Grill. After that he moved into managment in the Medical Marijuana Industry for 3 years. That was when he found coding and wanted a new career for himself. So off to the University of Denver he went for a Computer Coding Boot Camp to get him to this point in his life. In his free time Eric likes to Fly fish, play golf, and play any form of Poker. Which right now is Taiwanese Poker a somewhat unknown game that is played for points like Chinese Poker.</p>
